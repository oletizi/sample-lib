# Sample Library Manager

Node-based manager module for audio sample libraries.

Currently extremely simple. Supports:
* Loading a Javascript representation of a sample library from a filesystem
* Copying a library (or subdirectory of a library) from one directory to another
* Moving a library (or subdirectory of a library) from one directory or another
